        <h4> Hello, </h4>
        <p>
          My name is Kelsey and I welcome you to my website! Not long ago, 
          I was laid off by my job, so I figured this might be the perfect 
          opportunity for a career change! I worked in retail-management for 
          8 years and I think it's safe to say that this field is not for me.
          With that being said, I explored the world of technology and enrolled 
          myself in a bootcamp for software development. I hope by the end of 
          this course I will confidently be able to call myself a fullstack coder!
          Despite being at a crossword between front-end and back-end development, 
          I will strive to master both ends of the spectrum because versatility is 
          the most beautiful type of developer.
          Since the present is all I can focus on now, I want to create 
          beautiful websites one code at a time.
