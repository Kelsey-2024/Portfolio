#Personal-Website-II


##Description
  2.29.24 Happy Leap Year - This is part two of my personal website, the objective here is to add as many HTML files as I want. One of those files should be a contact page that submits success once all of the fields are filled and submitted. I wasn't happy with my last personal website so I created a new one from scratch. 
  Check out my last personal website to see my growth! https://github.com/Kelsey-2024/personal_site

  6.24.24 - I decided to make some major changes to this Personal Site --post graduation. 
    - First and foremost, I removed several files since I decided to go with a single page application (I've been quite obsessed with SPAs lately). 
    - Next, under "contact" I added a tag that allows recruiters and visitors to contact me via email instead of having to fill out a form - bye bye success message. Perhaps in the near future I will add a "message me" section under the contact me page to make it fun and less serious. 
    - The main thing I wanted to touch up on was my styling skills, so I decided not to use a package such as tailwind/bootstrap.

Here are some links that helped me format my site:

Here are some fun facts about me!
 - Skateboarding
  From the moment I first stepped foot on a board, I felt an exhilarating rush unlike anything else.
  With each heelflip and ollie, I soared through the streets, my spirit was unbound by the constraints
  of gravity. Skateboarding is a source of freedom, expression and empowerment. I tell myself, if I can
  skateboard, then I can do anything I set my mind to! 
 - Snowboarding
  Newbie snowboarder here, started two years ago because my skateboarding friends insisted that I would
  be good. As I mentioned above, nothing is an obstacle because I skateboard. My friends were right, I am
  really good and I truly enjoy this sport. I want to dedicate this section to them because they're constantly
  pushing me to try new things. I'm not sure where I would be if it weren't for them.
- Gardening
  My father was born in Cabo Rojo, Puerto Rico. The area he lived in was also known as 'El Campo', which is
  another way to say that he lived in the country-side. His days consisted of farm work, which was mechanically and physically taxing, but he loved every aspect of it -- growing produce and tinkering with machinery. My father taught me how to grow and nurture all types of plants, as well as build my own garden. Thank you Dad, you will continue to live in my heart and through the plants I grow!
