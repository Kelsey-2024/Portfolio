# Personal Portfolio

## Overview

Welcome to version 2 of my personal website - built from scratch to reflect both my technical growth and personal style. After completing my software engineering bootcamp, I wanted to create a single-page application (SPA) that was minimal, responsive, and designed without frameworks like Tailwind or Bootstrap - just clean HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

üìç ** Live Site:** Coming soon

## Features

- Custom dark/light theme toggle with icon animation
- Clean SPA layout with direct email link
- Responsive design without external CSS libraries
- Modal components for project previews

## Project Timeline

### February 29, 2024 - Initial Concept
I wasn't satisfied with my original site, so I started fresh. The initial goal was to create multiple HTML pages with individual routes, including a working contact form.

### June 24, 2024 - Major Refactor
Post-graduation, I converted the site into a single-page application to streamline navigation and content. The contact form was replaced with a simple email link to encourage direct communication.

## About Me

Aside from coding, I enjoy:

- üõπ **Skateboarding:** A source of freedom and empowerment - I believe if I can land a heelflip, then I can tackle anything.
- üèÇ **Snowboarding:** Started four years ago - big thanks to my friends who constantly push me past my comfort zone!
- üå± **Gardening:** Inspired by my father who grew up on farm land in Cabo Rojo, Puerto Rico. He taught me how to grow food and care for plants. I carry his legacy in every plant I nurture.
