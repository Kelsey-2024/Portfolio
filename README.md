#Personal-Website-II


##Description
  2.29.24 Happy Leap Year - Part two of our personal website is to add 2 more html files. We are expected to create a contact page that submits success once all field are filled and submitted. I wasn't happy with my last personal website so I create a new
  one from scratch. Check out my last personal website to see my growth!

Here are some links that helped me format my site:

Fun Facts
 - Skateboarding
  From the moment I first stepped foot on a board, I felt an exhilarating rush unlike anything else.
  With each heelflip and ollie, I soared through the streets, my spirit was unbound by the constraints
  of gravity. Skateboarding is a source of freedom, expression and empowerment. I tell myself, if I can
  skateboard, then I can do anything I set my mind to! 
 - Snowboarding
  Newbie snowboarder here, started two years ago because my skateboarding friends insisted that I would
  be good. As I mentioned above, nothing is an obstacle because I skateboard. My friends were right, I am
  really good and I truly enjoy this sport. I want to dedicate this section to them because they're constantly
  pushing me to try new things. I'm not sure where I would be if it weren't for them.
- Gardening
  My father was born in Cabo Rojo, Puerto Rico. The area he lived in was also known as 'El Campo', which is
  another way to say that he lived in the country-side. His days consisted of farm work and mechanical/physical
  labor, he loved to grow produce, tinker with machinery, or homes. My father taught me how to grow produce,
  flowers, and plants. Thank you daddy, you will continue to live in my heart!
